Problem: Create a Car class

Define a class named Car.
The Car class should have the following attributes:
make (string): representing the car's manufacturer.
model (string): representing the car's model.
year (integer): representing the year the car was manufactured.
mileage (float): representing the number of miles the car has been driven.
The class should have a method named display_info that prints out the car's information in a readable format.



solution
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year, mileage):
        # Initialize the attributes here
        pass

    def display_info(self):
        # Display the car's information here
        pass

# Example usage:
# car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022, 15000.5)
# car.display_info()
